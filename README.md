# Project-4-Udacity
Using Data Science to Gain Insights from Stack Overflow Survey Data
This work was completed as part of Udacity's Data Scientist for Enterprise course.

# Installation
The main content of this repository is a Jupyter Notebook running on Python 3.0.

To run the notebook you will need:

Python 3.0
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Sklearn
Juypter

# Project Motivations
As a French non professional developer who is trying to become a Data Scientist, I was interested to look at the Stack Overflow Survey data from 2017 and see what influence my own background and culture had on prefered ways of learning: https://karim-mary15.medium.com/3-things-that-will-make-you-see-learning-code-differently-557c5f3db44d


# File Descriptions

How to Interact with This Project
The best way to interact with this project is to open up the Notebook and browse through the code. The Notebook was saved with all code run so you can just look at the output (and my commentary) without having to re-run everything yourself. Feel free to edit the code and re-run if desired.

# Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, Etc.
The data was downloaded via Kaggle but is provided by Stack Overflow. As noted on the Kaggle site: "Data is directly taken from StackOverflow and licensed under the ODbL license."

The code was written by me, Karim Mary, with some functions copied (either word-for-word or in spirit) from Udacity coursework.

Thank you to Udacity and my company, Mars, Inc., for enabling me to take on this course!
